7001 = "This command forgets one or many local changes of SCM object(s) in the current workspace and the current image.
The SCM object can be a component (a framework, a module, a data component), a directory or a file.

A local change is a modification you have created or you have collected in your workspace, and which is not visible through the hierarchy.
Example with the workspaces Dev and Prj, Dev being a child of Prj:
1 - Dev is synchronized with the last revision of Prj in which the file \"File.txt\" exists.
2 - The file \"File.txt\" is officially checked-out in Dev, the file is modified and checked-in in Dev.
Dev owns the new change of content of \"File.txt\" as a local change.
3 - A Dev promotion is requested to Prj.
4 - The promotion is collected in Prj.
Dev still owns its local change (isolation).
Prj owns a new local change: the change of content of \"File.txt\"
5 - Prj is published.
6 - Dev is synchronized.
The change of content of \"File.txt\" is no more a Dev local change: it is seen through the workspace hierarchy.

Requesting a promotion of a workspace is in fact requesting the promotion of all the workspace's local changes.

If you use the option /p1
   The last local specified changes concerning the specified SCM objects are forgotten.
   The previous change of a forgotten change may be local or seen through the hierarchy.
   If the previous change is local, it will be promoted.
   Example:
   1 - Dev is synchronized with the last revision of Prj in which the file \"File.txt\" exists.
   2 - Into Dev, \"File.txt\" is moved to \"File1.txt\".
   3 - Into Dev, \"File1.txt\" is moved to \"File11.txt\".
   4 - The last local changes concerning this file are forgotten into Dev.
   This file is now seen as \"File1.txt\" (local change)
   5 - The last local changes concerning this file are forgotten in Dev.
   This file is now seen as \"File.txt\" (seen through the hierarchy).

If you use the option /p2
   All the specified local changes concerning the specified SCM objects are forgotten.
   The consequence is that the specified changes are now those seen through the workspace hierarchy.
   All the forgotten changes won't be promoted.
   Example 1:
   1 - Dev is synchronized with the last revision of Prj in which the file \"File.txt\" exists.
   2 - Into Dev, \"File.txt\" is moved to \"File1.txt\".
   3 - Into Dev, \"File1.txt\" is moved to \"File11.txt\".
   4 - All the local changes concerning this file are forgotten into Dev.
   This file is now seen as \"File.txt\".

   Example 2:
   1 - Dev is synchronized with the last revision of Prj in which the file \"File.txt\" exists.
   2 - Into Dev, \"File.txt\" is moved to \"File1.txt\".
   3 - Into Prj, \"File.txt\" is moved to \"File2.txt\".
   4 - Prj is published.
   5 - Dev is synchronized.
   A merge between \"File1.txt\" and \"File2.txt\" is supposed to be solved.
   6 - All the local changes concerning this file are forgotten in Dev.
   This file is now seen as \"File2.txt\" because it is the change seen through the workspace hierarchy.

The command fails if no change would be found after having forgotten: you can't create a SCM object and make it disappear with this command.
If the SCM object would be (seen as) deleted (by importing a deletion)
   The command fails if any contained element is checked-out in the current image, if you don't use the option /p3.
   The command fails if any contained element is checked-out in another image of the current workspace.";

(2) The data associated with the software objects seen as deleted are cleaned. Neither the software objects nor their modifications are cleaned themselves.
    The software objects that are considered are those which have been deleted for more than a time span or before a date.
    The analysis of the software objects is limited by the number nb_elts, and then the effective cleaning begins. The cleaning is performed software object by software object (with exceptions).
    The SCM commands support no inconcistency in all that is associated with the software objects. So no job can be started in a workspace tree while a software object's effective cleaning is running with it.
    If an effective cleaning is interrupted, it'll have to be terminated before the workspace tree will be unlocked.
(3) If any, the previous group cleaning finishes.
Because of database storage consideration, the cleaning can't be performed with one transaction:
- the objects to be cleaned are grouped nb_elts by nb_elts
- the cleaning of a database table is committed every nb_rows rows
(4) File contents in database are cleaned.
    The deleted workspaces cleaner have to be run before.
(5) Warning : this cleaning step cleans nothing in database. Only contents server is involved.
    File contents that are not referenced anymore by elements of the cleaning step (4) are cleaned.
